                 <p class="intro-quote"><em>“One wrong click. That's all it took to launch my coding journey — proof that even mistakes can rewrite your story.”</em></p>
                 <p>When I got my NYSC posting, I was ready to dive headfirst into healthcare. Like most corps members, I imagined a year of serving patients—not debugging code.
                 But fate had a better plan (and a wicked sense of humor).</p> 
                 <h2>🧭<strong> The Accidental Path Into Tech</strong></h2>
                 <p> Early on, I got curious about tech—especially UI/UX design and development. Problem was, every bootcamp I found came with a price tag that screamed, “Keep dreaming!” So I roped in a friend to help find a free bootcamp—because who doesn't love free stuff?</p>
                 <p> Months passed, hope was fading, and then boom—a flyer landed in my inbox from a program called Genesys Upskill, courtesy of a UI/UX cohort mate I'd met before. Little did I know, this link was my golden ticket into the world of coding, where<em> “Hello World”</em> is the starter handshake 🌍.</p>
                 <h3>💬<strong> From UI/UX to “Oops... Web Development”</strong></h3>
                 <p> After signing up, I got whisked into their Discord server—something I'd only heard gamers rave about. I had to pick my program, but “UI/UX” wasn't on the menu. So, like any rational person faced with options, I clicked Web Development—close enough, right? Turns out, that accidental click was my “Ctrl+Z” moment that launched a whole new journey.</p>
                 <h3>🏥<strong> From Health Service to HTML</strong></h3>
                 <p> Posted to a healthcare facility in Akpabuyo, Cross River State, I spent my days in medical mode. But when the ward got quiet—especially on night shifts—I swapped stethoscopes for code editors. No fancy gear or lightning-fast internet—just me, stubbornness, and a mountain of free tutorials from FreeCodeCamp, W3Schools, and YouTube.</p>
                 <h3>🌐<strong> 5 Lessons That Changed Everything</strong></h3>
                 <ol>
                     <li><p><strong>Free Resources Are Like Hidden Treasure</strong><br>Who knew the internet was this generous?the internet is a treasure trove if you know where to look.</p></li>
                     <li><p><strong> HTML &amp; CSS: More Than Just Fancy Letters</strong><br>Structuring and styling pages gave me a creative outlet beyond medicine. Who knew I'd get excited about making button change color?</p></li>
                     <li><p><strong>JavaScript: The Website's Secret Sauce</strong><br>At first, it was confusing AF. Then it clicked. Now I'm hooked.</p></li>
                     <li><p><strong>Git &amp; GitHub: Your Code's Best Friends</strong><br>Version control made me feel like a real developer-experimenting without fear of breaking everything.</p></li>
                     <li><p><strong>Building Projects Builds Confidence</strong>Theory's nice, but nothing beats actually making stuff that works.</p></li>
                   </ol>
                 <h3>💻<strong>Balancing Medicine and Code</strong></h3>
                 <p>Between treating patients, I squeezed in coding like a ninja:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Early mornings before rounds.</li>
                     <li>Weekends.</li>
                     <li>Quiet nights on call.</li>
                   </ul>
                 <p> No billion-dollar startups yet—just slow and steady progress.</p>
                 <h3>🌱<strong>Where I Am Now</strong></h3>
                 <p>Now, I'm all about front-end development—especially React and making sites look good on any screen.Plus, I'm diving into health tech—because who better to fix healthcare problems than someone who's seen them up close? My dream? To build tech that saves lives and to help other non-techies realize they can code too.</p>
                 <h3>💬<strong>To Fellow Corps Members</strong></h3>
                 <p>If you're in NYSC and thinking, “I know nothing about tech,” guess what? Neither did I. <em>“Your background isn't your limit—your mindset is.”</em> Use your service year not just to serve, but to start something new.</p>
